# Lesson 3
During this lesson, we made a little better **node server** than the one made during lesson 2.\
This project has **Sqlite3 database**, **GET endpoints** for the datatable users and the sensor data,\
and **POST endpoint** to the users.

## Dependencies
To make the server run, install **express** and **Sqlite3**:

```powershell
npm install express sqlite3
```

And start the server:

```powershell
node server2.js
```
