# Lesson 2
During this lesson, we learned how to print text to LCD-screen using **i2c-interface**.\
We also made a **backend with ThingSpeak**, and learned how to send data from a Pico W, \
and our own simple backend with **node.js** with a GET-endpoint that shows hard coded dummydata.\

## Dependencies
To make the simple node server run, you have to  install **express**.

```powershell
npm install express
```

The command to run the server:

```powershell
node server.js
```
