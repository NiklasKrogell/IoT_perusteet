# IoT basics
This repository contains all the tasks I have done during IoT basics course.\
In this course we used **Wokwi simulator** for simulating **Raspberry Pi Pico w**, and **micropython** for programming.\
We made couple small servers with **node.js** and frontend with **Google charts**.\
We also learned some basics about **webhooks** and **websockets**.\
For testing our api's, we used **Postman**.

## Full IoT pipeline
The last project I made in this course was a full IoT pipeline, where my simulated Pico W (Wokwi) sends temperature and humidity data to ThingSpeak-backend.\
From there, my frontend made with Google charts fetches the data and displays it in a linechart.
