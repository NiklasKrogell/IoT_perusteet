# IoT basics
This repository contains all the tasks I have done during IoT basics course.\
In this course we used **Wokwi simulator** for simulating **Raspberry Pi Pico w**, and **micropython** for programming.\
We also made couple small servers with **node.js**.\
For testing our api's, we used **Postman**.
